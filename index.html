            <h3 id="headline">Pekora's Personality:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pekora</strong> hails from the nation of Pekoland, where she claims she is a member of
                    royalty. While not much is currently known about Pekoland, it is assumed that its denizens are, like
                    Pekora, Animals humans with rabbit-ears and comparatively long lifespans, and that the rabbit-motif
                    apparent in Pekora's fashion and accessories is significant to their culture. </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>According</strong> to Pekora, "peko" is the only word in the Pekolandish language. In-line
                    with her claims of a royal upbringing, Pekora's personality can be described as outwardly bratty,
                    haughty, immature and surly, but genuinely playful and friendly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>When</strong> not on camera she has been noted by other hololive girls as polite and shy to
                    as she doesn't like people in her space, as well as one to internalize her pain (as noted by Houshou
                    Marine) which ended up prematurely ending one of her streams with her in tears.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pekora</strong> is infamous for mischief, to the point where other hololive members will
                    instantly become suspicious of any project if they learn that Pekora was involved. While her
                    intended victim is usually Sakura Miko, no one is exempt from her trolling, not even herself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pekora's</strong> fans appropriately display this same kind of attitude and are known to
                    ruthlessly tease her through the chat when the opportunity arises. In spite of everything, Pekora
                    still wants to be recognized as a real idol, but to her chagrin, fans mostly think of her as a
                    "comedian" and "crazy rabbit," not helped by her constant sprees of often self-inflicted misfortune.

                <p>
                    Pekora has a distinctive laugh (frequently represented in text as "AH↓ HA↑ HA↑ HA↑") somewhat
                    resembling that of an older female aristocrat, and frequently interjects her sentences with the
                    "-peko" suffix, though she has been known to forget this occasionally. She asserts her dominance by
                    shouting "PE↗ KO↘ PE↗ KO↘ PE↗ KO↘."
